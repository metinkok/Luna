# Luna
This is my passion project. I will add new and change existing methods while my knowledge expands.
For using set up the mood command in Luna you need to create playlist with .wpl extension and it name must be one word.
For using movie night commands you need to create Movies.txt which contains movie names and movie names must be also one word
For both of the movie night and set up the mood commands you need to either change the path in the code or create those files matching with the path
For movie night set up you need to name your mp4 files all caps and only alpha numeric values I didn't test otherwise better safe then sorry
